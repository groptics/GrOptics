\begin{abstract}
GrOptics is a detailed simulation program for ray-tracing Cherenkov
photons through large arrays of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
Shower packages, such as GrISU \cite{GRISU} and CORSIKA \cite{CORSIKA},
provide Cherenkov photons after conversion to GrISU format. The output
to a ROOT file records individual photons striking the camera surface.
The package models both VERITAS Davies-Cotton (DC) and Schwarzchild-Coudee
(SC, SEGSC) telescopes with all telescope parameters taken from input
files. There is no limit to the number or type of array telescopes.
Adding new telescope types or input and output formats, is straightforward
using standard C++ coding techniques with existing base classes. Reference
\cite{GROPTICS} gives the GrOptics download site.

\section{Introduction}

\label{S:INTRO} GrOptics is a detailed C++ Monte Carlo ray-tracing
program to study the passage of atmospheric Cherenkov photons through
telescopes designed to study atmospheric Cherenkov air showers. Photons
produced by standard air shower codes enter the telescope; the output
ROOT file contains tree records of the photons that strike the telescope
cameras. GrOptics provides the input to the CARE telescope electronics
code \cite{CARE}.

There are no intrinsic limits to the number or type of telescopes
placed in the air Cherenkov telescope (ACT) array. Currently, the
code contains three telescope classes: for VERITAS DC telescopes,
SC telescopes, and for SC telescopes with segmented mirrors. Input
pilot or configuration files contain all the array and telescope parameters.

\subsection{Installation}

\label{SS:INSTALL}
\begin{enumerate}
\item GrOptics relies heavily on ROOT\cite{ROOT}. I use the following installation
method: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Be sure you have installed gsl for use by ROOT 
\item Download the ROOT source package \cite{ROOT} 
\item Follow package instructions to compile and link ROOT; it's best not
to specify a \textendash prefix directory. 
\item Setup all necessary ROOT environmental variables by sourcing \emph{thisroot.sh}
or \emph{thisroot.csh} in your \textless rootDirectory\textgreater/bin 
\end{itemize}
\item The SC and SEGSC telescope classes use the ROBAST package \cite{ROBAST}.
ROBAST (ROot BAsed Simulator for ray Tracing) is a non-sequential
ray tracing program which utilizes the 3D geometry library in ROOT.
The ROBAST package is automatically downloaded by \emph{curl} within
\emph{make} when producing the GrOptics executable. GrOptics currently
uses ROBAST version 4.2.1 which requires an edited source file to
be compatible with GrOptics. The new file is copied using Makefile
commands to the ROBAST src directory prior to compilation. These details
should be transparent to all users. 
\item After installing ROOT, download the GrOptics git repository \cite{GROPTICS}.
Go to the GrOptics directory and run \emph{make} to produce the grOptics
executable. The ROBAST download and file copy occurs during this step.
\item To test the installation, execute \emph{grOptics} from the GrOptics
directory. The code will use the default configuration and pilot files
and a test Cherenkov photon file, all within the GrOptics/Config directory,
to produce an output root file, \emph{photonLocation.root}. Other
test possibilities (see later sections) for using this configuration
are telescope drawings and psf camera plots. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{QuickStart}

\label{SS:QSTART}

The \emph{grOptics} executable can use the configuration and pilot
files and a test Cherenkov photon file, all within the GrOptics/Config
directory, downloaded with the git repository. The file, \emph{opticsSimulation.pilot}
steers the simulation and specifies the output. The file, \emph{arrayConfig.cfg},
defines the ACT array. You'll see the downloaded file defines a four-telescope
array that is compatible with the \emph{photon.cph} test input Cherenkov
photon file. The first telescope is a SEGSC telescope; the remaining
thre are DC telescopes. The parameters in these files are documented
both in these files and in following sections in this document.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Execute the grOptics code from the GrOptics directory to produce \emph{photonLocation.root}
as specified in \emph{opticsSimulation.pilot}. You'll find the output
trees with records of the photons on the camera surface for each telescope
in this file. You'll also find a history ROOT file for each telescope
which documents the history of each photon incident onto the telescope
(useful for debugging). You can turn off the creation of these history
files by removing the leading asterisk of the \emph{PHOTONHIST }record.
\item To create an \emph{opengl} drawing of a telescope using the ROOT geometry
classes, add a leading asterisk to the \emph{DRAWTEL} record in \emph{opticsSimulation.pilot},
select the telescope, and execute \emph{grOptics}. Note that for DC
telescopes, the code does not draw the mirror facets as the ray-tracing
for the facets does not use the ROOT geometry classes. For SC and
SEGSC telescopes, the ROOT geometry classes will draw the complete
telescope, including photon ray-traces if you have selected that option.
\item To change telescope types, open the \emph{arrayConfig.cfg} file and
activate the appropriate telescope factory record. Then, in the \emph{ARRAYTEL}
records use the DC, SEGSC, or SC telescope types. You can then run
the same tests as described above. 
\item To produce a series of spot patterns on the camera using internally
produced photons, activate the \emph{TESTTEL} record in \emph{opticsSimulation.pilot}
by adding a leading asterisk.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Code Overview}

\label{S:OVERV}

See \emph{DevelopersGuideGrOptics.pdf} for more details. This section
only introduces standard telescopes, telescope arrays, and the various
coordinate systems used in GrOptics.

GrOptics uses standard C++ plus ROOT and the ROBAST package.

\subsection{Standard Telescopes}

\label{SSS:STEL}

The GrOptics package currently produces telescopes from each of three
telescope factories, for DC telescopes, SC telescopes and for SEGSC
telescopes. All telescope parameters are in configuration files to
maintain maximum flexibility. However, having separate configuration
files for each array telescope leads to large, unmanagable file sizes.
Thus, the factories can produce a limited number of standard telescopes
based on configuration files in the \emph{GrOptics/Config} directory.
The factories then use edit records taken from the configuration files
to change specific telescope parameters, e.g. the mirror reflectivity,
thus maintaining complete flexibility for parameter selection for
individual telescopes. The edit records use matlab colon notation
so that a single record may change a parameter for a range of telescopes
and elements within each telescope, e.g., facet reflectivities. Edit
records for additional parameters can easily be added. Currently,
this editing procedure is only possible for DC telescopes; I'll add
similar editing later.

None of the telescope dimensions or super structures may be edited.
Changing these dimensions requires a separate standard telescope.

\subsection{Telescope Arrays}

The telescope factories provide individual standard telescopes, after
editing, to the ACT array as defined by telescope type, standard ID
number, ground location, and pointing offset. Telescope numbering
starts at $1$, not $0$.

\subsection{Coordinate Systems}

Understanding the coordinate systems used in our simulation codes
is always difficult, especially if your memory is as bad as mine.
So, these descriptions should help. 

\subsubsection{GrISU Ground Coordinate System}

The GrISU Cherenkov files either from GrISU or from the CORSIKA I/O
Reader use the following coordinate system:

\noindent \hspace*{20pt}x: East \\
 \hspace*{20pt}y: South \\
 \hspace*{20pt}z: Down \\
 to form a right-handed system

\subsubsection{GrOptics ground coordinate system}

The incoming GrISU produced incoming photons are immediately transformed
by GrOptics to the system:

\noindent \hspace*{20pt}x: East \\
 \hspace*{20pt}y: North\\
 \hspace*{20pt}z: up\\
 forming a right-handed system. The telescope locations in the VERITAS
GrISU configuration file use this coordinate system.

\subsubsection{Telescope Coordinate System}

Each telescope has a coordinate system with origin at the telescope
rotation point and with z axis pointed toward the sky along the optic
axis of the telescope. In stow position (DC telescopes), the z axis
is horizontal and pointed toward the North, the y axis is down, and
the x axis is toward the East. To point the telescope to a given location
on the sky, GrOptics first rotates the telescope about the vertical
through the azimuthal angle. Then, it raises the telescope about its
new x axis through the elevation angle. This new coordinate system
is the \char`\"{}telescope coordinate system\char`\"{}. Prior to injection
into the GTelescope class, the photons undergo a coordinate transformation
to this telescope coordinate system.

\subsubsection{Array Coordinate System}

Prior to added pointing misalignments, all telescopes point to the
same location on the sky with coordinate systems previously defined.
The array coordinate system is similarly defined, but its origin is
at the origin of the array.

\subsubsection{Camera Coordinate System}

For historical reasons, the camera coordinate system's y axis is a
reflection of the y-axis of the telescope coordinate system. For the
VERITAS telescope, stand in front of the camera with the telescope
in stow position. The camera y axis is up and the camera x axis is
to your right (to the East). The telescope y-axis is down; its x axis
is to the right.

In the output tree of grOptics, the photon locations on the camera
are in camera coordinates for all telescope types. I'll add an input
flag later to select photon camera locations in either telescope or
camera coordinates.

\subsubsection{Azimuth, zenith angle, and elevation}

In all cases, the azimuthal angle is measured from the North toward
the East. The zenith angle and elevation are measured as usual.

\section{Input Files}

\label{S:INPUT} The git repository contains input files for steering
the simulation, setting up the array, and defining the standard telescopes.
These files have unique record flags and can be self-referential for
combining into single files.

\subsection{Simulation Steering}

\label{SS:STEER} The default input steering file is \emph{GrOptics/Config/opticsSimulation.pilot}.
Execute \emph{grOptics -h} so obtain command line options to use other
filenames. The \emph{opticsSimulation.pilot} file is fully documented.
Much of the documentation is reproduced here for completeness.

The \emph{opticsSimulation.pilot} file contains the following records.
Each record has a leading asterisk (not reproduced here) when active.
In the following list, the bolded name is the record flag with the
adjustable parameter listing following.
\begin{description}

\item [{PHOTONHISTORY}] \textless ROOT filename, tel.number to be appended
\textgreater \textless tree name\textgreater \\
 
\end{description}
%-------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{Array Configuration}

\label{SS:ARRAY} The default array configuration filename, set in
\emph{GrOptics/Config/opticsSimulation.pilot}, is \emph{GrOptics/Config/arrayConfig.cfg}.
This file specifies telescope locations, types, and configuration
files for standard telescopes. Edit records for individual telescopes
usually appear in this file. The \emph{arrayConfig.cfg} file is fully
documented. Much of the documentation is reproduced here for completeness.

The array defined here may be a subset of the array used to create
the photon file.

%    \textless \textgreater
% \begin{quote}
% \end{quote}
\begin{description}
\item [{TELFAC}] telescope factory type and parameters

\textless factory type: DC, SEGSC, or SC \textgreater \\
 \textless photon reader type: GRISU (only option) \textgreater
\\
 \textless configuration filename \textgreater \\
 \textless telescope edit filename \textgreater \\

\item [{ARRAYTEL}] parameters listed below 
\begin{quote}
\textless telescope number, \textgreater $0$ \textgreater

\begin{quote}
0: no printing \\

2: add geometry details \\
3: add facet details \\
 
\end{quote}
\end{quote}
\end{description}
%-------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{Telescope Parameter Editing}

\label{SSS:TEDIT}

The telescope editing records in the git repository are contained
in the \emph{arrayConfig.cfg} file. The editing flags are \emph{EDITDCTEL}
for DC telescopes and \emph{EDITSCTEL} for SC telescopes. Only the
\emph{EDITDCTEL} are currently implemented.

\subsubsection{Colon Numbering Notation}

The colon numbering notation (used in Matlab and Octave) is useful
for containing multiple entries in a single record. It is easily explained
with several examples. \\

\begin{quote}
$[1:3]=[1\;\;2\;\;3]$ \\
 $[1:3\;\;5]=[1\;\;2\;\;3\;\;5]$ \\
 
\end{quote}
\noindent Thus, if the telescope number in an EDITDCTEL record is
$[1:3]$, the telescope parameter changes defined on the remainer
of the record will apply to telescope numbers 1, 2, and 3. Similarly,
if the telescope number is $[4\;\;5:8\;\;10\;\;11]$, the changes
will apply to telescopes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10,and 11.

\subsubsection{DC Telescope Editing}

The edit records normally are placed in the \emph{arrayConfigure.cfg}
file. These edit records apply to specific telescopes, not to standard
telescopes. The telescope factories create the telescopes and then
look for edit records specific to that telescope.
\begin{description}
\item [{EDITDCTEL}] DC telescope edit record 
\begin{quote}
\textless telescope number (matlab notation)\textgreater \\
 \textless edit Flag1 \textgreater \emph{FACET} only current option
\\
 \textless facet number (matlab notation) \textgreater \\
 \textless edit Flag2 \textgreater \emph{align} or \emph{reflect}
are current options
\begin{quote}
Parameter following \emph{align} \\
 \textless maximum misalignment (degrees)\textgreater \\

Parameters following \emph{reflect} \\
 \textless blur radius \textgreater \\
 \textless mirror degradation factor \textgreater \\
 \textless reflective curve (int) \textgreater \\
\end{quote}
\end{quote}
Examples: \\
 EDITDCTEL {[}1:2{]} FACET {[}1:50{]} align 0.5 \\
 EDITDCTEL {[}5:10{]} FACET {[}10:100{]} reflect 0.2 0.95 2
\end{description}

\subsubsection{SC Telescope Editing}

The edit records normally are placed in the \emph{arrayConfigure.cfg}
file. These edit records apply to specific telescopes, not to standard
telescopes. The telescope factories create the telescopes and then
look for edit records specific to that telescope.
\begin{description}
\item [{EDITSCTEL}] SC telescope edit record, no options implemented at
present 
\end{description}

\subsection{Standard Telescopes}

\label{SSS:STEL1} The telescope DC and SC factories produce standard,
editable telescopes for the array. The standard telescope configuration
files are given in the \emph{arrayConfiguration.cfg} file.

%-------------------------------------------------------------


\subsubsection{Davies-Cotton Telescopes}

\label{SSS:DCTEL} At present, the only implemented DC telescope is
the VERITAS telescope. Please be careful about changing the dimensions
of this telescope. In particular, the dimensions and placements of
the supporting quad arms and cross arms for the focus box are tightly
coupled to the telescope dimensions. The file, \emph{GrOptics/Config/veritas.cfg},
defines 4 standard VERITAS telescopes, all with identical dimensions.
The file contains a series of records partially defining each of the
4 standard telescopes followed by a sample, partial VERITAS telescope
configuration file from the GrISU VERITAS simulation package.

%-------------------------------------------------------------


\subsubsection{Schwarzchild-Coudee Telescopes}

\label{SSS:SCTEL}

%-------------------------------------------------------------


\section{Data Files}

\label{S:DATAF} %-------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{Input Data Files}

\label{SS:INDATA} The photon Cherenkov file begins with a header
followed by photon lines (see \emph{GrOptics/Config/photon.cph}. The
header file contains information passed from shower and photon production
code. All header information must occur between the initial HEADF
flag and the final DATAF flag which indicates the start of data records.
The following data records are from the beginning of the \emph{GrOptics/Config/photon.cph}
file: \\
 \\
 R 1.000000 \\
 H 1307.645000 \\
 S 0.80000 50.0 -50.0 -0.2500 0.4330 1307.6 -1000 -10777 -32656 \\
 P -1.4 79.9 -0.2519 0.4403 13509.0 239.0 534 3 2 \\
 P -0.2 79.6 -0.2518 0.4402 13531.4 237.5 498 3 2 \\
 The \emph{R} record carries the photon thinning fraction. \\
 The \emph{H} record carries the observatory height in meters \\
 The \emph{S} record indicates the start of a new shower and contains
information about the primary in this order: %\begin{enumerate}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
%\begin{enumerate}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}

\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}
\begin{enumerate}

\item y coordinate of the core (meters) 
\item x-direction cosine of the core 
\item y-direction cosine of the core 
\item observatory height (meters) 
\item three negative random-number seeds
\end{enumerate}
\noindent The \emph{P} record contains the Cherenkov photon details
as follows:

\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item x-coordinate (meters) on the ground relative to an individual telescope
at telescope level for CORSIKA or at ground level for KASCADE. 
\item y-coordinate (meters) on the ground relative to an individual telescope
at telescope level for CORSIKA or at ground level for KASCADE. 
\item x-direction cosine in ground coordinates 
\item y-direction cosine in ground coordinates 
\item height (meters) of emission 
\item relative time (nsecs) of emission 
\item wavelength (nanometers) 
\item particle type 
\item telescope id number intercepting the photon 
\end{enumerate}
%-------------------------------------------------------------


\subsection{Output Data Trees}

\label{SS:ODATA} 

\subsubsection{allTel Tree}

The allTel tree contains information that is constant for all showers
in the file. The tree branches are as follows: 

\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}
\begin{enumerate}

\item telLocZVector vector\textless{}float\textgreater{} 
\item transitTimeVector vector\textless{}float\textgreater{} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Individual Telescope Tree}

Each telescope has its own tree. The branches are as follows:

\setlength{\itemsep}{0cm}\setlength{\parskip}{0cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item eventNumber eventNumber/i 
\item primaryType primaryType/i 
\item primaryEnergy primaryEnergy/F
