GrOptics is a ray-tracing package for telescope arrays containing a combination of 
Davis-Cotton (DC) and Schwarzschild-Couder (SC) optical systems.  The DC telescope 
class models a standard Veritas telescope using a grisudet configuration file. The SC
class models an ideal SC telescope. For version 1.0, the SC telescope shape 
parameters are hard coded in the GSCTelescope class. 

GrOptics accepts input from GrISU compatible photon files.

1. Version History

       VERSION 1.0 (v1.0)
       svn revision number: r1353

       version 2.0 (will update files to "v2.0" soon)
       svn revision number 1553  USE THIS SVN VERSION, -r1509
          see new testtel option in opticsConfiguration.pilot file

       version 2.1:  svn revision number: r1646  
       added rotation and translation error offsets for all elements of 
       an SCTelescope by containing the secondary mirror and the
       camera/focal surface in individual geovolumes and then using
       rotation and translation transformations to position these
       volumes in the top volume. This might increase the execution
       time a bit, but we need the error offsets. A later version will
       provide mirror roughness reflection. 
       Revised SC camera parameters to conform
       with Nepomuk's camera description; documentation in 
       stdSCTelescope.cfg configuration file.  Substantially 
       cleaned up the code, more to do however. Now using
       robast v1.4.3.

       current working version is: r1662 or later. use this for
       mirror roughness and robast v1.5.0_beta. Code won't compile
       until AOpticsManager.h is updated in robast - that should 
       occur today or tonight: March 8 2012
       -----------------------------------------------------------------------
       VERSION 2.2: 
       main addition was a CAMRAD record in veritas.cfg file. 
       as follows:
       //////////////
       camera radius in mm (for veritas Rmax for pixel position is 357.58 mm
                     pixel radius is 14.00 mm. so 375.00 mm is the camera radius
       including the camera restricts the photon locations to lie within this radius on
       the camera plane.  If left out, all photons striking the camera plane extended
       across the entire base of the focus box will be recorded in the root file.
       * CAMRAD 1 375.0
       * CAMRAD 2 375.0
       * CAMRAD 3 375.0
       * CAMRAD 4 375.0
       ////////////////
       SC telescope parameters now in SC configuration file
       ////////////////
       continued cleanup of code. 
       only one veritas config file, veritas.cfg, now. And it's an abbreviated version
       All files have this new version number and 10MAY2012 date.

       code cleanup in progress, no version number change as cleanup progresses
       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       VERSION 2.3
       fixing code hanging for large telescope arrays. Tested ok for up to 100 telescopes.
       lots of code cleanup.
       better documentation in README plus continued work on doxygen code documentation
       see ArrayConfig.cfg file for using default values (no change) for degradation factor
       and for mirrorReflCurveID for DC telescopes. Makes EDITDCTEL easier to use.
       git tag "v2.3" 4Oct2012

       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       VERSION 2.4
       Fixed wobble offsets so that the wobble offsets in the
       opticsSimulation file are in the camera coordinate system, y axis
       up, and x axis to the East (increasing azimuth).  The source
       location in the output root file is in camera coordinates.

       rewrote az/zn/rotation procedures in GUtilityFuncts. All tests are
       ok.

       tag name: v2.4
       "git checkout v2.4" to access but will be master commit until merge
       beta branch to create v2.5 after merging.        

       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       VERSION 2.5
       added DEBUGBRANCHES option in opticsSimulation.pilot to provide
       additional branches carrying details of the core location in
       telescope coordinates and in shower coordinates to each telescope
       tree (useful for testing). No change in logic from v2.4.
       Continued to clean up the code.

       tag name v2.5
       --------------------------------------------------------------------------
       VERSION 2.6
       fixed spot plots for SC telescope by adding platescale record in
       stdTelescope.cfg file. But, I forgot to make the version change in
       each file.  I'll fix that next.
       
       tag name v2.6
       --------------------------------------------------------------------------
       VERSION 2.6a
       version change now 2.6a in each code file and pilot/cfg file.  Added
       optional record to set space to reserve prior to each shower for
       photon vectors (can take default - this is mostly for checking
       memory use). Set defaults for plateScaleFactor entries in
       veritas.cfg and in stdSCTelescopes.cfg (can just take default to get
       usual values) - this is only for making spot plots; has no effect on
       ray tracing.

       tag name: v2.6a

       -------------------------------------------------------------------------
       VERSION 3.1
       CorsikaIOReader can include a C line following the S line in the
       GrISU-type input file. The C line parameters are simply passed to
       the root file and written to three new branches in each telescope
       tree.  So, there is some duplication in the telescope output trees

       tag name: v3.1

1. Installation

   Dependencies: ROOT, Gsl, robast	
   Check out current version from git repository at Georgia Tech

   <need url here>

   The Makefile will download the robast package from sourceforge and compile its libraries. 
   These libraries and the source code will be in the GrOptics/v1.4.3 directory.  The robast package, 
   written and maintained by Akiri Okumura, contains the ROOT geometry add-on classes used 
   to construct the SC telescopes. For more details go http://sourceforge.net/projects/robast/ 
   and to http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4448.
   
   The executable is grOptics

   to see command line arguments
   <prompt> grOptics -help

2. Tests

   All files to test the grOptics code are included in the tarball.  The tests use the 
   Config/photon.cph photon file containing a single 0.8 TeV shower. The test telescope
   array is defined in Config/arrayConfig.cfg as 3 veritas-type telescopes and a single 
   SC telescope, all located in a square array. The veritas.cfg file contains a standard
   veritas configuration file plus additional records needed by GrOptics at the head of this
   file.

3. Documentation

   See the GrOptics/README/ files. Each configuration file in GrOptics/Config is fully 
   documented.

   Expect fairly frequent updates.

branch name: v400Beta.  All changes now in this branch, will merge
later
