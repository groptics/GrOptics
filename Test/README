1. The root script, comparePhotonLocationTrees.C, compares the photon camera locations and incoming
   directions from two grOptics root output files, The script reads a given tree from two output root files and
   plots of photon locations and directions in one tree versus that variable in the second tree. It provides
   an output table of the first 30 entries in the trees for a detailed comparison.  Finally, it tests each pair
   of locations or directions and provides a count of the number of pairs that differ by a given amount using
   TMath::AreEqualAbs(a,b,episilon) where episilon is set in the code to 0.0001.

   See the comments at the begining of comparePhotonLocationTrees.C for more details in using this code.  It is
   very useful in testing code revisions that should not change the output photon location or direction values.
