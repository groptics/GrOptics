configuration file to produce a "veritasDaviesCotton" configuration file
for GrOptics.

Only records with an initial "*" are active.

The VGA_ReadDCStdGrISU reader creates standard telescopes for use with the 
DCTelescope factory. The reader uses a standard
GrISU configuration file to make standard telescopes based on 
instructions given in TELSTD records, each of which specifies a
telescope from the GrISU configuration file for creating the 
standard telescope.  

The DC factory will produce a DC Telescope based on a given DC standard 
telescope (see the array configuration file). Each individual array 
telescope may be edited from edit records in the array configuration file.

Telescope standard selection record
  - standard telescope id number. Must be >0, but does not
      have to be sequential nor start from 1.
  - telescope number in GrISU configuration file
  - standard geometry number. The geometry specification is
    not part of GrISU config.file (see following PILOTF record)
  - ray-tracing algorithm number 
        - 0: root structural shadowing turned off
        - 1: shadowing as in grisudet (uses ROOT only for structural shadowing)
  - average transit time in nsec (from the telescope plane to camera for photons
    normally incident on the telescope plane.
  - print option for this standard telescope
     0:  no printing
     1:  print summary information
     2:  add geometry details 
     3:  add facet details

camera radius in mm (for veritas Rmax for pixel position is 357.58 mm
                     pixel radius is 14.00 mm. so 375.00 mm is the camera radius
including the camera restricts the photon locations to lie within this radius on
the camera plane.  If left out, all photons striking the camera plane extended
across the entire base of the focus box, but at camera level will be recorded
 in the root file.

GRIDF defines an ordered hash table for fast searches for facet hits.
The hash table is a 2D grid that is either produced by the code or read
from a file. There is a separate grid for each standard telescope.
     - standard telescope number
     - gridFlag
         0, no grid, full facet/pixel loop 
    	 1, make grid and use grid in facet search
    	 2, made grid and write to filename:
       	   in later searches read this file rather than calculating 
       	   the grid (to be implemented soon) 
         3, read grid if file is available, else make and write grid
     - nbinsx, number of bins in the x direction
     - nbinsy, number of bins in the y direction
     - fileName, name of grid file (for either reading or writing)
Default (no GRIDF record) do full loop sequentially over all facets.

* GRIDF 3 2 15 15 gridfileStdDC1.txt

additional pilot files to combine with this file
can have more than one on the following PILOTF record
Files listed here is a veritas cfg file and the standard geometry records for the root
shadowing routines.
