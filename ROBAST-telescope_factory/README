ROOT-Based Simulator for Ray Tracing (ROBAST)

1. About
ROBAST is a non-sequential ray-tracing simulation library which is aimed for wide use in optical simulations of cosmic-ray and gamma-ray telescopes. The library is written in C++ and fully utilizes the geometry library of the ROOT analysis framework. ROBAST offers several functionalities required for ray-tracing simulations of cosmic-ray telescopes. 

The advantages of using ROBAST are
- Easy to build complex telescope geometries using TGeo* and AGeo* classes (ROOT and ROBAST classes, respectively)
- Runs on both OS X and Linux
- Scriptable in C++ and Python
- Easy to learn even if you could not be a Geant4 expert
- Direct analysis of simulation results in ROOT
