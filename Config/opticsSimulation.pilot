  Steering pilot file for GrOptics
  Used for testing versions
VERSION4.0 
30May2016

This version (4.0) contains the new segmented sc telescope class, factory, and
reader.  It will continue to evolve with better documentation over the next
months. Thus, you should do a git pull fairly often. I'll alert you to any
major changes via e-mail.  I'm currently updating the pdf User's Guide; in
the meanwhile, additional documentation for the new SEGSC class is in this file,
the arrayConfig.cfg file and the new devSegSCTelescopes.cfg file.  Please
read these files carefully to save consternation later.

The segmented telescope class is based on the NewSCT.C root script by Akira
Okumura. you can find this script in GrOptics/scripts/NewSCT.C.

The DRAWTEL options are useful for SEGSC telescopes as is the "single mapmt module"
option for confirming your camera position - see comments at the end of
this file.

THE CODE IS ALL SET TO RUN. JUST "make" AND EXECUTE "GrOptics". You should 
see an ogl image with the paths of 20 photons across a segmented mirror SC
telescope.

ToDo's include: making the printoption consistent across telescopes, using
valgrind for memory usage and leak testing for the new segsc code, making
the screen/log output nicer, adding error offsets for the focal surface.

I also have not yet specified axes for the rotational errors (segsc only).
As you see other details to be added, please let me know.

If you are not on the GrOptics email list, I can add your name;

Only records with an initial "*" are active.  

cherenkov photon GRISU-type input file, 
same type input file as for grisudet. 
FILEIN <filename>  
* FILEIN ./Config/photon.cph

see GrOptics/Make_Photons/README to create this test file
 FILEIN ./Make_Photons/veritasStarOffset.cph

camera output root file specification type
      - root file name
      - name for tree containing parameters common to all photons
      - base name for photon trees, one tree per telescope, 
        telescope number appended to base name
      - photonDirCosine flag: 0/1, if 1 add dirCosineCamera branches
      If you plan to use any utility scripts, you should use the parameter
      values given in the git repository file, i.e. photonLocation.root allT T 1.e
FILEOUT <root filename> <TreeName> <telBaseTreeName> <photonDirCosBranchFlag>
* FILEOUT photonLocation.root allT T 1

name of grOptics log file, default use cerr (if no asterisk)
 LOGFILE logTest.log

number of showers/photons, defaults -1
  NSHOWER <numShowers, <0, no limit>
          <numPhotons, <0, no limit>
NSHOWER -1 -1
* NSHOWER 1 50
You can see the paths of all 20 photons in the ogl image when you
run the code (all photons from the photon.cph test input file).

WOBBLE <X> <Y> <R> <latitude>
where X and Y are the coordinates of the source in the camera
field of view and R is the source extension radius (all in degrees).
The fourth parameter is the latitude of the observatory in degrees. 

If the latitude is set to 90 degrees X and Y give the source position along the
camera axes.  If the latitude is less than 90 degrees, Y is the
offset along the hour circle toward Polaris; X is the offset along 
a perpendicular to the hour circle in the direction of increasing azimuth.
These offsets are thus not parallel to the camera axes.

Example: 
wobble Y, North: WOBBLE 0.0 0.5 0.0 31.675  (offset toward Polaris)  
wobble X, East : WOBBLE 0.5 0.0 0.0 31.675  (offset perpendicular to hour circle)
* WOBBLE 0.0 0.0 0.0 90.0

array configuration file
 ARRAYCONFIG <filename: default ./Config/arrayConfig.cfg>
* ARRAYCONFIG ./Config/arrayConfig.cfg

random number seed for TRandom3: default seed = 0, set by machine clock.
seed must be an unsigned integer
* SEED 12345

vector capacities: may be useful for memory management, set to 100 if
vector is left out. Seems to work ok up to 1000000 for my machine (lots of
memory).  Should just set to 100 and forget about it (hopefully)
* VECCAPACITY 100

photonHistory file, no history file if no asterisk, each telescope has 
a history file
Very useful for code tests and debugging
 PHOTONHISTORY <root file, tel.number appended to base name> 
               <tree name: default = "his">
* PHOTONHISTORY photonhistory.root his

core/telescope location in grd.and tel.system branches added for debuging.
default 0 for compatibility with earlier opticsSimulation.pilot versions.
* DEBUGBRANCHES 0
///////////////  draw possibilities for checking configuration and
                               debugging
			       
DRAWTEL <telescope number>  <drawtel option>          
The code makes an opengl drawing of the telescope and immediately 
stops with the root prompt. These are cool drawings.

For segmented SC telescope, option 0: only draw telescope
                            option 1: draw MAPMT module and MAPMT camera
                            option 2: draw all of the above.

                            option 10: plot rays reaching cathode or focal
                                       surface on telescope image
                            option 20: plot all rays on telescope image
			    For options 10 and 20, limit the number of photons
			    using the NSHOWER record above to something like
			    100 photons or you will be sorry.
NOTE: for ideal SC telescope, camera is not drawn - coming soon.

For DC telescopes, option 0 is the only possibility and the facets are not drawn
(they are not placed in the root geometry nodes and the ray-tracing algorithm
does not use root geometry methods due to slow execution issues.  You may get
strange results if you use other options for drawing DC telescopes (to be fixed
soon)

* DRAWTEL 1 20
 DRAWTEL 2 0

TESTTEL <telescope number> <baseFileName for histograms>   
THis is a very useful option for producing spot histograms and spot rms
plots; the code doesn't use a photon input file; the photons are internally
produced. However, at present, you still need a valid photon input file 
in the above FILEIN record.

Makes histograms and graphs of psf width and psf spot for a number of 
photon incident angles. Makes histograms and graphs for transit time width
for the same incident angles.  Be sure to set the number of photons to some 
small number in the NSHOWER record; the code does not stop after making the 
test graphs. DO NOT ADD A ROOT EXTENSION TO THE BASEFILENAME, THE CODE WILL
DO THAT.
The graphs and histograms are printed to png files using the base filenames.

TESTTEL <telescope number> <baseFileName for histograms>   
 TESTTEL 1  PsfSegSpot

fixed telescope pointing option is now in the array configuration file
See the ARRAYTEL record to set fixed pointing for individual telescopes
