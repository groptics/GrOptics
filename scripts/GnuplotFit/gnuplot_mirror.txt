Hello Charlie,

I determined the coefficients, kzp[] and kzs[], by fitting the surface with
14th order polynomials with the following commands in gnuplot.

gnuplot> f(x)=p0+p1*x**2+p2*x**4+p3*x**6+p4*x**8+p5*x**10+p6*x**12+p7*x**14 
gnuplot> fit f(x) 'zf.dat' using 1:2 via p0,p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,p6,p7 
gnuplot> plot 'zf.dat' using 1:2, f(x)

can also plot residuals

gnuplot> plot 'zf.dat' using 1:($2 - f($1) 

The attached files: zf.dat and zs.dat are R vs Z values of the primary and
the secondary calculated from the equations in

Since the range of R used in the fit is [Rmin, Rmax], kfp[0] and kfs[0] are
not exactly zero.

Regards,
