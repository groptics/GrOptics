- code isn't backward compatible with the original stdSEGSC configuration. Is that ok?  if so,
  we need to remove the original stdSEG config file or update it so it's compatible.
- code requires either root5 (only tested with root5.34) or root6 (tested with root 6.02)
- minor opengl issues on osx using root6 (need to confirm for linux)
- serious opengl issues on osx using root5 (need to confirm for linux)
- confirm that serious opengl issues go away for SC telescopes, which suggests
  that the opengl problems are in the GrOptics code and most likely in the SEGSC
  telescope class??? In the distant past, there were no opengl problems with earlier
  versions of root.
- When we finish testing, I'll update the version number in all files
- Need to update documentation, I'll start on that.
- fix code to remove all compile warnings (this might fix the opengl problems).
  I'll start on that.
