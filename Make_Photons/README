see the pilot file for more documentation

usage: using the repository makePhotonsOffset.pilot
       
          make
          makePhotonsOffset

to create the veritasStarOffset.cph file containing 500,000 photons on each
telescope. Telescope locations and radii are in the
pilot file (or they can come directly from a veritas.cfg telescope 
configuration file, e.g. ../Config/veritas.cfg.

IMPORTANT: for use with grOptics, make sure that the telescope locations
used here agree with locations given in the ARRAYTEL records in the 
GrOptics/Config/arrayConfig.cfg file. However, you only need include a 
subset of the telescopes from the arrayConfig.cfg file here (you might
be only interested in one telescope for the many specified in the 
arrayConfig.cfg file).  

Note that as specified in the makePhotonsOffset.pilot file, the photons 
all are incident from the zenith with no wobble offset.  See the pilot file
for instructions about changing the photon directions relative to the 
direction of the telescope.  

Use veritasStarOffset.cph as the input file either to grisudet or 
to grOptics (set the filename. From the grisudet photonhistory files,
you can, for example, use the standard utility code to move the 
photon history file into a root tree.  Then from the treeviewer, you 
may wish to plot the facet hits:
    facetX vs facetY where reflectFlag>0 (successful facet
    reflections or onFacetFlag > 0 (on facet hits).  
You can also compare the above plots with the shadowing on and with the
shadowing off to see the effect of shadowing and to test the shadowing geometry.

For grOptics, you can use either the the photonLocation.root file or
the photonhistory_Telx.root file to produce a variety of interesting 
plots, often involving cuts on the status and nPoints parameters. These
are described in the GrOptics Users Guide. in the GrOptics/README 
directory,

Future Plans: 

enter more than one wobble offset in the pilot file
so create a given number of photons for each wobble offset.  This
will enable us to create root scripts, for example, to have better 
control over plotting the point-spread function. At present the 
plotting is hard coded in the GrOptics code.

Make example plots for inclusion in the Users Guide.
